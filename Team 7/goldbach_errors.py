Goldbach Conjecture: Every positive even integer can be written as the sum of two primes.
This algorithm finds two primes that sum to a given even integer (or reports that no such primes can be found).
First, it checks that n is an even integer. Then it iterates over all two-number partitions of n and returns the
first one for which both numbers are primes. Primality is checked using a helper function that tries to divide
n by every value smaller than it (other than one), and returns False if no such value was found.
Parameters
    ----------
    n : integer
    
    Returns
    -------
    i, n-1 : two prime integers, if found
